ECE 4504 Tournament Prediction README:

Please go through the instructions below to get familiar with edumips.

Once you have cloned to the repository then follow the commands:

$ ant standalone-jar
$ java -jar edumips64-1.3.jar [--debug]

Load a program and you will see the statistics resetted.

Then you have to execute and wait and you will see at the end when the program stops or when you stop, the resulted statistics.

If you run in debug mode you will be able to see the info like which branch prediction is being selected, different data structure getting initialized, etc. But the simulator becomes slow little slow if --debug mode is used.

To see the local Branch History Table and pattern Table at every iterations, uncomment the line no. 52


EduMIPS64 README
================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/lupino3/edumips64.png)](http://travis-ci.org/lupino3/edumips64)

EduMIPS64 is a cross-platform visual MIPS64 CPU simulator written in
Java/swing. 

The EduMIPS64 web site is http://www.edumips.org. There is also a 
developers' blog at http://edumips64.blogspot.com.

To learn how it works and how to use it, please refer to the
EduMIPS64 User Manual (in the docs/{en,it}/output/latex directory). This file
is a short guide for developers who are interested in compiling the
simulator from scratch and/or modifying its source code.

The JAR for the latest development version is available at
http://lupino3.github.io/edumips64/edumips64-latest.jar (built by Travis CI
every time a new revision is pushed).

Requirements
------------

In order to compile EduMIPS64, you need the following tools:
- Java JDK version 7 or above.
- Apache Ant version 1.8 or above (needed for JUnit 4 tests)
- Sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org/) versione 1.0.7 or above
- GNU Make
- JavaHelp

The two latter dependencies are needed for the in-application help.

If you need to compile the PDF manual, you will also need:
- latex / pdflatex

If you want to use the automatic style checks (pre-commit hook), then you
should have Automatic Style (astyle) installed.

A distribution of JUnit 4 and JavaHelp is included in the libs/ directory of
the git reposiory, but not in the source tarball.

This project uses Travis CI for continuous integration
(https://travis-ci.org/lupino3/edumips64).

Main Ant targets
----------------

* `standalone-jar` builds the jar package named edumips64-`version`.jar, that
  embeds the JavaHelp libraries, and is oriented towards users downloading the
  JAR archive from the website (not through package managers).

* `slim-jar` builds the jar package named edumips64-`version`-nodeps.jar, that
  does not embed the JavaHelp libraries and is oriented towards distribution
  package creators, that should add a dependency on JavaHelp and appropriately
  set the classpath in their scripts.

* `docs` builds the user documentation (both in-app HTML and PDF)

* `clean` removes the jar files, the build directory and the compiled
  documentation

* `test` runs unit tests;

* `cli-jar` build a jar package containing an experimental CLI front-end

* `src-release` builds a tar.bz2 file containing the source distribution

* `javadoc` builds the javadoc documentation; will store it in the `javadoc`
   directory.

Setting the CLASSPATH
---------------------

Any ant target that requires the compilation of the source code (i.e.,
creation of application JARs or running unit tests) require that the JavaHelp
jar is in the CLASSPATH; in addition to this, running unit tests and building
the javadoc require the JUnit 4 jar to be in the classpath. Example::

  CLASSPATH=/usr/share/java/jhall.jar ant
  CLASSPATH=/usr/share/java/junit4.jar:/usr/share/java/jhall.jar ant test
  CLASSPATH=/usr/share/java/junit4.jar:/usr/share/java/jhall.jar ant javadoc

Compilation options
-------------------

Set those variables to modify some compile-time options:

* src_java_version (default: 7): Java version of source code;

* dst_java_version (default: 7): bytecode target version;

* debug (default: on): whether to compile with debugging info;

To set any variable, use the -D option of ant.
